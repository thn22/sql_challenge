# sql_challenge
## Description of the Project
In this project, I was tasked to do research on people who worked for Pewlett Hackard during the 1980s and 1990s. I was required to design tables to hold data from six CSV files, import those files into a SQL database, and answer questions regarding the data.

## Languages and Liabraries
This project used PostgreSQL, PGAdmin and QuickDBD (for creating ERD).

## Analysis and Discussion
See employee_database_results.sql for tables and analysis.
